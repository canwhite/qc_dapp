# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true yarn hardhat test

# init project
yarn hardhat
yarn hardhat node # run stand-alone
yarn hardhat compile # run in-progress
yarn hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.ts
```
